‚ú® Introduction to C++ Programming
A high-performance language supporting procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.

üåé Overview of C++
C++ is a powerful language that builds on C by incorporating features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Developers often choose C++ for:
‚Ä¢ Systems programming (OS kernels, drivers)
‚Ä¢ Game development (graphics engines, real-time systems)
‚Ä¢ High-performance applications (finance, simulations)

‚è≥ History and Evolution of C++
‚Ä¢ Created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs around 1979.
‚Ä¢ Originally named ‚ÄúC with Classes.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Gained the name ‚ÄúC++‚Äù with more advanced features and broader functionality in the 1980s.
‚Ä¢ Continues to evolve with modern standards (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20‚Ä¶), improving library support and language capabilities.

‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Your Environment
Choose an IDE
‚Ä¢ Visual Studio (Windows)
‚Ä¢ Code::Blocks (Cross-platform)
‚Ä¢ CLion (Cross-platform)
‚Ä¢ Visual Studio Code (with C++ extensions)

Install a Compiler
‚Ä¢ GCC (Linux, macOS, or Windows via MinGW)
‚Ä¢ Clang (macOS, Linux)
‚Ä¢ Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (Windows)

Create and Compile Your First Program
‚Ä¢ Use your chosen IDE or a command-line tool.
‚Ä¢ Example (Linux/macOS Terminal):

bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
‚Ä¢ Example (Windows Command Prompt with MinGW):

bash
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
main.exe
üèóÔ∏è Basic Structure of a C++ Program
Headers: Use #include to bring in libraries.
main Function: Execution starts here.
Statements: End with semicolons (;).
Namespaces: Often use std::, or declare using namespace std; (though the latter can be discouraged in larger projects).
Example: Hello World
C++
#include <iostream>  // Library for input/output

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World! üëã" << std::endl;
    return 0;  // Indicates successful execution
}
In this code:
‚Ä¢ We include for console I/O.
‚Ä¢ main() is the entry point.
‚Ä¢ std::cout writes to the console.
‚Ä¢ std::endl flushes the output buffer, ensuring it prints immediately.

üöÄ Another Example: Hello Universe!
C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, Universe! üåå" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
This snippet showcases the same structure but prints ‚ÄúHello, Universe!‚Äù instead.

üå± Next Steps
‚Ä¢ Experiment with different compilers and IDEs to find your preferred setup.
‚Ä¢ Explore object-oriented concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
‚Ä¢ Dive deeper into memory management, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL).
