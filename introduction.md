# ‚ú® Introduction to C++ Programming üöÄ

A high-performance language ideal for systems development, game engines, and other demanding applications.

## üåé Why C++?
C++ combines the power of C with modern features like classes and polymorphism. Developers often choose C++ for:
- **Systems programming**: OS kernels, device drivers.
- **Game development**: Graphics engines, real-time systems.
- **High-performance applications**: Financial systems, simulations.

## ‚è≥ History and Evolution
- **1979**: Bjarne Stroustrup created ‚ÄúC with Classes‚Äù at Bell Labs.
- **1980s**: Renamed to ‚ÄúC++‚Äù with more advanced features.
- **Modern Standards**: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and beyond continue to expand functionality and improve library support.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Your Environment
1. **Choose an IDE**:
    - Visual Studio (Windows)
    - Code::Blocks (Cross-platform)
    - CLion (Cross-platform)
    - Visual Studio Code (with C++ extensions)
2. **Install a Compiler**:
    - GCC (Linux, macOS, or Windows via MinGW)
    - Clang (macOS, Linux)
    - Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (Windows)
3. **Create and Compile Your First Program**:
    - Example (Linux/macOS Terminal):
      ```bash
      g++ main.cpp -o main
      ./main
      ```
    - Example (Windows Command Prompt with MinGW):
      ```bash
      g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
      main.exe
      ```

## üèóÔ∏è Basic Structure of a C++ Program
A simple C++ program consists of:
- **Headers**: Use `#include` to bring in libraries.
- **main Function**: Execution starts here.
- **Statements**: End with semicolons (`;`).
- **Namespaces**: Often use `std::`, or declare `using namespace std;` (though the latter can be discouraged in larger projects).

### Example: Hello World
```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Library for input/output

int main() {
     std::cout << "Hello, World! üëã" << std::endl;
     return 0;  // Indicates successful execution
}
```
In this code:
- We include `<iostream>` for console I/O.
- `main()` is the entry point.
- `std::cout` writes to the console.
- `std::endl` flushes the output buffer, ensuring it prints immediately.

### Another Example: Hello Universe!
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
     std::cout << "Hello, Universe! üåå" << std::endl;
     return 0;
}
```
This snippet showcases the same structure but prints ‚ÄúHello, Universe!‚Äù instead.

## üå± Next Steps
- **Experiment**: Try different compilers and IDEs to find your preferred setup.
- **Explore OOP**: Learn about classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Dive Deeper**: Study memory management, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL).
