# ✨ Introduction to C++ Programming

A high-performance language supporting procedural, OOP, and generic paradigms.

## 🌎 Overview of C++
• Builds on C with classes, inheritance, and polymorphism  
• Commonly used for systems programming (OS kernels), game development, and high-performance apps

## ⏳ History
• Created by Bjarne Stroustrup around 1979  
• Originally “C with Classes,” later renamed “C++”  
• Modern standards (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20…) expand library support

## ⚙️ Setting Up Your Environment
• IDEs: Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion, or VS Code  
• Compilers: GCC, Clang, or MSVC

## 🏗️ Basic Structure of a C++ Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World! 👋" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 🌱 Next Steps
• Explore classes, inheritance, and polymorphism  
• Dive deeper into memory management, templates, and the STL  
• Keep experimenting and enjoy coding!
